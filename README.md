Hi,

My Name Is Muzamil. If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? 
Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?.
You can find the answers for all these questions with the help of visualisations and some cool things that have helped us to get results that actually some of the apps 
show fake reviews for more customer engagement.

Thanks
